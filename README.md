CHEMICAL   REACTIONS AND ENERGY
In Module 3 we discussed the processes involved in chemical reactions by considering from a particle   perspective with atoms being reorganized through   the breaking of   bonds in reactant and the making of   the   new bonds in the products. The difference in the energy needed to break then bonds and the energy   released when the bonds are made is the basis of   our understanding the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions. The study of   the interconversion of   heat and other forms   of   energy,   a   very    important branch of   chemistry, is known as   thermodynamics. It enables chemists   to predict,   with   some   degree   of   confidence,      whether a particular chemical reaction   will proceed in a given   direction.   Thermochemistry,   a   sub branch of   thermodynamics, is the study of   heat changes that    take place during chemical reactions.
We have already observed that energy is involved in physical changes such   as   changes   of   state. When   a solid is heated, the forces of   attraction that hold the particles of   the solid in place in the lattice can be broken. This allows the particles more freedom of   movement and, as more heat is supplied, their kinetic   energy (energy of   movement) increases.   Temperature   is a measure of   the average kinetic   energy   of   all the   particles in a substance.

Nearly every chemical reaction either produces or absorbs energy.   This   is         generally in the form. of   heat, although light and sound are   sometimes   also      observed. Human activity has been characterised by the use of   combustion   reactions involving the burning of   carbon-based fuels such as    wood and   coal for thousands of   years. More recently, industrialisation has    come about through the burning   of   a wider range of   fossil fuels, in    particular oil   and natural gas, with the resulting increase in carbon dioxide    in the atmosphere contributing to global climate change. This has led to a    quest   for ways to trap and use renewable sources of   energy   such as   solar    power   and for the development   of   technologies   for using   new energy sources      such as hydrogen   gas.
The combustion of   natural gas, methane,   produces carbon dioxide and water:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g)    →       CO2(g)    +    2H2O(g)    +      energy
The same products are formed during respiration, the process by which glucose is reacted with oxygen    to provide energy for metabolic processes:
C6H12O6(s) +   6O2(g)    →      6 CO2(g)    +    6H2O(g)      +      energy
ENDOTHERMIC AND   EXOTHERMIC   REACTIONS
When a “gummy   bear‟ is placed in some molten   potassium chlorate there is a huge explosion as   the sugar   is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water. The energy   of   the molecules in the sugar   (reactant) is greater than the energy    of   the   carbon   dioxide and water (products) and    the   enormous   amount of   excess   energy is released to the   surroundings as heat and   light.

You can watch this experiment athttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lfnOTNlqtY
When hydrogen and oxygen gases react together, water is produced along with a   considerable amount   of   energy. We could write the equation for the reaction as:
2H2(g)       +       O2(g)                      →         2H2O(g)    +      energy
This energy is liberated in the form. of   heat and in the   form. of   sound   energy   (there is   a   loud   bang).      All      the   energy lost by the system is gained by the surroundings and we say it   is   an   exothermic   process.   Energy   released is   by definition,   negative   and in an exothermic process   the      total   energy of   the products   must be   lower than the total energy ofthe reactants.
When mercury(II) oxide, HgO, decomposes energy must be   supplied for the reaction to proceed. The   equation for the reaction can be written as:
2HgO(s)       +       energy       →                   2 Hg(ℓ)   +         O2(g)
This reaction is called an   endothermic process   and the   energy   supplied is   by definition,   positive.   In endothermic processes the total energy of   the products must be higher than the total energy of   the   reactants.

ENTHALPY
The energy content of   a   system is the sum of   the kinetic   and potential   energies of   all the   system    components.   It is not possible to measure the total energy of   a   system but the   energy change   during a    reaction is measurable and particularly useful. When a reaction is carried out at a constant pressure the      heat   of   the reaction (amount of   heat transferred during the reaction) is defined as the   enthalpy   change,      and is   given the   symbol   ΔH. The enthalpy (heat content) of   a   system has the symbol   Hand “Δ” is used    to signify a “change         in” or “difference in”   . Hence,   ΔH   for a reaction will be the difference in enthalpy    between the reactants and         the products.
ΔH   =   Hfinal   -   Hinitial         =   Hproducts   -   Hreactants
This means that for an endothermic process   Hfinal      >   Hinitial      so ΔH   > 0.   For an exothermic process   Hfinal    <   Hinitial    so   ΔH   < 0.

1.                         What does the symbol ‘ΔH’   stand for?
2.                         What is the definition   of   enthalpy?
3.                         Which is greater in an endothermic reaction,   energy of   reactants   or   energy   of   products?
4.                            Does a positive enthalpy value indicate   energy   gained   or   lost?

Activity 4.1 - Enthalpy and Thermochemical Equations
INFORMATION
Most chemical reactions are accompanied by a change in energy which is usually released to or absorbed from the surroundings in the form. of heat. The result is a change in temperature. The thermodynamic name associated with thermal energy is enthalpy, which has the symbol H.
When a reaction gives off heat to its surroundings, the energy of the system decreases. The reaction is said to be exothermic and the change in enthalpy ΔH is negative.
When a reaction absorbs heat from its surroundings, the energy of the system increases. The reaction is said to be endothermic and the change in enthalpy ΔH is positive.
A chemical equation for which the enthalpy change ΔH is given is called a thermochemical equation.
For example: C(s) + ½O2(g) → CO(g) ΔH = -111 kJ mol-1 (1)
This equation tells us that when 1 mol of solid carbon reacts with ½ mol of gaseous oxygen 1 mol of gaseous carbon monoxide is formed and 111 kJ of energy are released.
If the equation is reversed energy is needed to break CO into C and O2.
Increasing the number of moles increases the energy needed/released. So
2CO(g) → 2C(s) + O2(g) ΔH = +222 kJ mol-1 (2)
It is important that physical states be included in thermodynamic equations. For example, the enthalpy changes for the following reactions are different.
H2(g) + ½O2(g) → H2O(g) ΔH = -242 kJ mol-1 (3)
H2(g) + ½O2(g) → H2O(ℓ) ΔH = -285 kJ mol-1 (4)

THERMOCHEMICAL EQUATIONS
A thermochemical equation links the enthalpy change for a reaction to the molar   amounts   in   a      balanced   equation.
For example:   The energy released when hydrogen and oxygen react to produce water is   572 kJ per mol.   This   can be      written as:
2H2(g)       +       O2(g)             →         2H2O(g)                      ΔrH   = -572 kJ mol-1
ΔrH   is the enthalpy change for the reaction.
•             It is important that physical states be included in thermodynamic   equations. For   example the       enthalpy   changes for producing H2O(ℓ) is different than   for   H2O(g)
2H2(g)       +       O2(g)                →                2H2O(ℓ)                      ΔrH =   -584 kJ mol-1
•             When the coefficients in an equation are changed the value of   ΔrH   is changed   accordingly.   For      example:   H2(g)    +    ½   O2(g)      →    H2O(g)                                  ΔrH =   -286 kJ mol-1
•             Similarly if   the reaction is reversed the magnitude of   the value of   ΔrH   does not change but the    sign   is   reversed.
2H2O(g)       →         2H2(g)       +       O2(g)                   ΔrH   = +572 kJ mol-1
•             Enthalpy changes for   given amounts of   reactants can be calculated using ΔrH   and the masses   of   reactants   or products used.
For example:   To   calculate the heat energy released when 200 g of   octane, C8H18,   is burned.   C8H18(ℓ)       +    12.5 O2(g)      →   8CO2(g)      +      9H2O(g)                     ΔrH   =   -5470   kJ mol-1
M   (C8H18) =   114 gmol-1
n(C8H18) =   m/M   = 200   g/114 gmol-1    =   1.75 mol
From the equation:   1 mol C8H18(ℓ)    releases 5470 kJ
So   1.75 mol releases:    5470 kJ mol-1    ×   1.75 mol =   9596 kJ
NOTE:   The enthalpy change quoted for a reaction is given the units ‘kJ per mole”   . This means per “mole of   reaction”.
To explain this we could consider a mythical reaction:   2A    +      3B            →    4C
When   one   mole   of reaction   has   taken   place, two   moles   of   A   and   three   moles   of   B   will   have   reacted   to produce four moles of   C.   So   one   mole of   reaction means “for the reaction as   in the   given   equation”   .
If   more or less than one mole   of   reaction   is    involved, the energy per mole of   reaction   is   determined   first   and   then this value is scaled according to    how much reaction actually took place.
For example: For the reaction                               2H2O(g)         →          2H2(g)       +       O2(g)                   ΔrH   = +572 kJ mol-1
When 2 mol   of water   decomposes   to   give   2 mol   of   hydrogen   gas   and   1 mol   of oxygen   gas,   572 kJ   of   energy   is   needed.   However, for   the   reaction:
H2(g)    +    ½   O2(g)      →    H2O(g)                            ΔrH =   -286 kJ mol-1the mole of   reaction refers to the energy released when   1 mol H2    reacts with ½ mol O2    to produce   1 mol H2O.
Watch the video “Thermochemical Equations” (12 min) which is on Nuku.

(i)          6C(s)    +    3O2(g)      →         6CO(g)   (ii)       2CO(g) →         2C(s)    +      O2(g)

(ii)       Calculate the mass of SO2   needed to produce 3000 kJ of   energy
BOND   ENERGY AND CHEMICAL CHANGE   Bond properties
Bond order, bond length and bond enthalpy are all inter-related.   Bond order   relates   to   the number   of   electron    pairs shared between any two bonded atoms. In single bonds where   one electron pair is shared the   bond order is one. For a double bond, where two pairs of   electrons are   shared, the bond order   is two   and   it      is three for a triple   bond.
Bond length   is the distance between the nuclei of   the atoms in a bond   at the point   of   minimum energy.   Bond lengths depend on the size of   the atoms    involved in the bond and the bond order. As the      bond order increases the nuclei are more strongly attracted to the bonded   electrons pulling   the   atoms   closer      together and the bond length will decrease.
Bond enthalpy or bond dissociation enthalpy   is the   energy   needed to break   a   bond in   1   mole   of gaseous molecules. The strength of   a bond will depend on how   strongly the nuclei   are   attracted to   the bonding electrons. Since   energy   is always needed to   break a   bond,   enthalpy   of   bond breaking will       always   be   positive   i.e. ΔHbond breaking    > 0. The same amount of   energy needed to break a bond is    released when the      same bond is made.

Activity 4.2   Making and   Breaking   Bonds
Chemical reactions can be a lot like playing with Legoreg;—you must take apart part of your last creation before you can replace it with something new. For many chemical reactions, we have to first break bonds in the reactants before we can put the atoms back into a new arrangement to form. the products. Both of these processes involve changes in energy. The net energy change for a reaction is called the heat of reaction or the change in enthalpy (ΔH).

2.          Identify four reactions where bonds are being formed.
3.          Decide on the correct word to complete   each   sentence below:

4.          Find two reactions in the table that are exact opposites   of   each   other, that   is,   one reaction   is the reverse   of   the   other   reaction.
(i)                How do the changes   in   energy   for   the   reverse reactions   compare?

(ii)             For   Reaction   A   of   how   many   P–Cl   bonds   are   broken   with   the   966.7   kJ   of   energy   listed?
(iii)          Calculate the energy needed to break one mole   of   P–Cl bonds   in Reaction   A.
6.          Use the data in the table above to   answer the   following   questions.
(i)                Calculate the energy needed to break   one   mole   of   P–Cl   bonds   in   Reaction   B.
(ii)             Do the P–Cl bonds in different molecules require the   same   amount   of   energy to break?
Bond energies can be very useful (as you will soon discover) for calculating the net energy change in a reaction. However, a table listing the bond energies for even the most common substances would be several pages long. For this reason, chemists often approximate energy changes using average bond energy.
